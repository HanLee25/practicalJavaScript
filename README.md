# Practical JavaScript

Study note of 'Practical JavaScript' course from [WatchAndCode.com](https://watchandcode.com/courses/enrolled/60264)
My personal goal with this course, being able to read JavaScript code as I read verbal language that inspired by the book [Speaking JavaScript] and [JavaScript in Plain English] blog.

[Speaking JavaScript]: http://speakingjs.com/es5/
[JavaScript in Plain English]: https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english

## Topics

The whole course is about making a todo list.
And each topic walks you through how to do that with the key concept of JavaScript. With these learnings, I tried to cross-interpret from JavaScript to verbal English and vice-versa.
Each section of topics has short conclusion 'Speaking JavaScript' which is the interpretation (mostly from the instructor Gordon) of JavaScript concepts in verbal language. (e.i `function` > recipe)
