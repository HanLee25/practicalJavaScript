# Process

## Step 1: Why Practical JavaScript should exist?

**Problem Statement:** There isn't a resource out there that teaches the way to utilize the skill in a cohesive experience.

- cohesive

    characterized by or causing cohesion.

    - cohesion

        unity, togetherness, solidarity, bond, continuity

A common JS learning resources are design to teach the syntax and features of the language. But they're missing the context to explain how to build and make things with those skills.

> It's like teaching only grammar in the writing class.

## Step 2: Why the todo list?

The todo list is relevant to nearly every application, because the way they're structured is similar.

### Features to build

- Add a to-do item
- Toggle a to-do item
- Toggle all to-do items at once
- Edit a to-do item
- Delete a to-do item

## Step 3: Development Process

This course lead to start a simple application and add and improve which similar to a product lifecycle. As the application grows, the new technique and skill are increasingly introduced in the iterative approach.

Each topic is:

- starting with the preview of the goal in high level
- specifying requirements and small action items

> How to break a big problem down into simple tasks is one one of the biggest prats of programming.

> The hard part that most people struggle with,  which is not a technical issue, it's more of a problem-solving issue - breaking a big thing into small and simple things.
